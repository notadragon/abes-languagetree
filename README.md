# The-Modding-Tree

An incremental game engine based on The Prestige Tree. It still requires programming knowledge, but it's mostly pretty easy things and copy/pasting.

[Look here for a tutorial on getting started with modding with TMT](docs/tutorials/getting-started.md)

You can look in the [documentation](docs/!general-info.md) for more information on how it all works, or look at the code in [layers.js](js/layers.js) to see what it all looks like.
